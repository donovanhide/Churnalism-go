Notes on site styling
---------------------

I'm using a customised bootstrap 3.

The aim is to be able to easily track changes/improvements to bootstrap,
rather than being left with a diverging fork.

The current approach is to tweak just bootstrap variables.less file -
which defines overall colours and the like - but leave the rest of it
unchanged.
Anything else is overridden in our custom stylesheet, css/style.css.
Because it's included after the bootstrap css, we can override whatever
we need.



To build:

a) grab the bootstrap source
b) set up a build environment to build it (nodejs, grunt etc...)
c) copy over less/variables.less with our custom one.
d) build bootstrap (
     $ grunt dist
   ...and copy the resulting files back.


Not sure if this minor-modification-plus-an-overrides-file approach is
the right one. It's still to early to tell.

Alternate approaches:

1) just bite the bullet and maintain a custom fork of bootstrap.
   Probably gives the best results, but it's a lot of overhead and
   complexity - both in tracking changes and just setting up the build
   environment.

2) don't modify bootstrap at all, and do _everything_ via overrides in
   style.css. This is probably simplest, but I'm not yet sure how much of
   an arse it'd be - you have to override all the basic typography settings,
   for example, without the benefit of the css preprocessor you have in
   options 1).

3) ditch bootstrap and just use custom CSS. The site is simple enough that
   this is probably the right thing to do.... buuuut.... well, there's just
   too many nice shiny things you get (mostly) for free with bootstrap -
   responsive layouts etc...
